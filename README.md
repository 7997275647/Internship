#Abstract

 Rapid advancements in Narrow Band Internet of Things (NBIOT) technologies have highlighted the need for comprehensive testing environments that can assess the reliability and performance of state machines in these kinds of systems. This report on a research internship presents an evaluation of a new test environment for state machine applications in NBIoT communication systems, focusing on a smart gas meter application by Honeywell Elster GmbH, and highlights the need for robust testing methods in the field of embedded systems and IoT devices. By integrating Finite State Machine (FSM) applications into NBIoT and CAT-M1 technologies, the internship explores different test methods, and strategies on the state machine application using MATLAB test environment in a pilot project called EI4 NBIOT. Through a comprehensive analysis that includes state coverage, transition testing, model checking, and more, the report describes the process from test case development to execution and provides insights into the effectiveness of the test environment and the potential for its adoption in software development processes. The implications of this study suggest that the deployment of such specialized testing environments can considerably contribute to the optimization of NBIOT communications, ensuring devices like smart gas meters operate with the intended efficiency and reliability. The successful application and evaluation of the test tool as part of the EI4 NBIOT project offers promising avenues for future research and development efforts in the field of IoT technologies
